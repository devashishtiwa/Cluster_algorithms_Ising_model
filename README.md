The 2D Ising model stands as a momentous model in physics, showcasing a genuine phase transition. It
was solved exactly by Ernst Ising (1D) in 1920 and in 2D analytically solved by Onsager(2D)4 in 1944. We
here present the methods to solve Ising model using three different approaches. Due to its lack of intrinsic
dynamical evolution, its simulation relies on Monte Carlo algorithms. Particularly near its phase transi-
tion, the Metropolis algorithmâ€™s efficiency declines sharply, a limitation circumvented by the SW and Wolff
method. Critical exponents describe this phase transition, their determination and comparison to theo-
retical values form the bases of this report. Finally, the performance of all three algorithms is compared.
We then apply the use of these cluster algorithms to Hard sphere model, and presented its comparison
with theoritical description, concluding this study which is conducted as part of the Computational Physics
course (PHY612N) taught by Dr. Sunil Pratap Singh at the Department of Physics, IISER Bhopal.
